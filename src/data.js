You could easily spend your entire vacation admiring iconic sights like the Eiffel Tower, wandering through exhibits at the Louvre and strolling through the beautiful green space admiring flowers at the Luxembourg Gardens. Still, you should save some time for people-watching and munching on fresh croissants at sidewalk cafes during the day. Once the sun sets, sit down for a decadent French meal with amazing wine.`,
